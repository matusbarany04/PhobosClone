## Description 

It's year 2033. Solar panels sucked all energy from the Sun and it disapeared. Without our star, the Moon exploded and ocean inflow stopped. Wind power became useless too. The seas on the Earth started to evaporate, resources got tight, people started to starve and fight over the food.

And when all seemed dark and people started to lose their faith, the one with the solution has arised from darkness - Elon Sus. Finally, there was a hope for survival. The only thing you needed to do was to sell your soul to get money and get on the one of many Elon's starships powered by black matter. 

Our web app makes it barely an inconvenience to buy a ticket to your brighter future. You can also buy all the accesories you may need for your flight trough our website and they will wait for you all nicely packed on your starship. I hear you saying: "But I don't have enough money," but don't worry, you will work it off by ten maybe twenty years in our final destination. 

## Prototype

Lastly, you'll see launch time, price for your flight and all the people waiting for you in space.
